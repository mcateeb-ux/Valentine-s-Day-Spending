# Valentine-s-Day-Spending
R HW#2 Introduction to R Tidyverse in DataCamp (Quiz Questions 6 and 7).
Completed for ADAN|ADEC7900.

The National Retail Federation's spending data indicates that consumer 
preferences with respect to Valentine's Day products are shifting. 
Consumer spending has increased across all categories since 2010; 
however, it has increased more rapidly in select categories as shown 
in the provided plot. Specifically, spending on categories such as 
candy, clothing, gift cards, and jewelry has doubled or nearly doubled 
since 2010. Spending on evenings out and flowers has increased by 
approximately one third, while spending on greeting cards has increased 
by just 26 percent.

According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, the Consumer Price 
Index has increased by approximately 30 percent since 2010. Thus, 
nominal sales were likely higher in the evenings outs, flowers, and 
greeting cards categories due to inflation as opposed to higher 
quantities of products sold. Thus, to stock our inventory for these 
categories, we should expect roughly the same level of demand as we 
have seen in recent years.

For the four categories that saw spending double or nearly double in 
the time between 2010 and 2022 (i.e., candy, clothing, gift cards, and 
jewelry), roughly half of that growth is inflationary while the other 
half is likely due to shifting preferences and increased demand for 
these products. Fifty percent growth over 12 years represents an annual 
growth rate equal to approximately 3.4 percent (calculated as 
follows:((1.5)^(1/12)-1)). Thus, to stock our inventory for these 
categories, I recommend assuming demand will be 3.4 percent higher 
next year than it was this year.
